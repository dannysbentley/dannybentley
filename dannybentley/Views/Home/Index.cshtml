                        I’m an architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) technology enthusiast. I truly believe that our industry is on the verge of something remarkable. The current state of our industry is scattered and slow pace.  It’s perfect for us to optimize, digitize and automate large parts of our industry.  I want to be part of this journey to learn, teach and experiment with all things tech in the AEC space. Follow me on Twitter and Youtube.
